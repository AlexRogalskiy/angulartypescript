This repository will contain the code samples from the book "Angular Development with TypeScript", Second Edition (see https://www.manning.com/books/angular-development-with-typescript-second-edition) migrated to Angular 8.

At this point we don't make any promises regarding the timing, but you can always migrate the code samples by yourself by following the instructions at https://update.angular.io.
